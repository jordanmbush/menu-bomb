# menuBOMB
Menu Bomb is a web application that allows restaurants to easily host their menu online, without the hastle of setting up a site from scratch. Customers can search for different restaurants by name, or item, and browse all menu items easily. Customers can also easily place orders, and add notes to their orders for the restaurant to see. Restuarants can review their dashboard to see new orders, and update their status for the customer to see.
Menu Bomb was a team built application. It uses the MVC design pattern, and was developed with agile principles, and the SCRUM methodology.
